        <div class="text-std" style="color: white">As of writing, I just launched the basic layout of the site you see now last night. Since I'm actually hosting the site now, it felt a little weird to just leave it as a blank site so here's my first post. I picked up HTML/CSS 3 days ago so hopefully by the time you read this, my site looks a bit more presentable than what I'm looking at now. This is probably going to end up as a blogging site where I write about hobbies and projects that I'm working on with a professional section on the side. Originally, this was going to be project for the summer but scrolling through some sites to learn HTML led to some experimentation which turned into something of a weekend addiction. So here I am. Now, I've never written a blog till now so I hope you'll stick around to see where this site goes!</div></div>
